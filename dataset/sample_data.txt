Welcome to Mobile LLM Lab, your complete solution for training AI models on your phone.
Training machine learning models has never been easier than with our integrated pipeline.
You can fine-tune models like GPT-2, BERT, and many others directly from Termux.
Google Colab provides free GPU access, making training fast and efficient.
Simply add your training data, configure your model, and let the system handle the rest.
This sample dataset demonstrates the text format - one training example per line.
You can replace this file with your own data or create new dataset files.
The training script automatically handles text, CSV, and JSON formats.
Each model you train gets its own folder with checkpoints and configuration files.
Models are automatically pushed to your Hugging Face account when training completes.
You can train multiple models simultaneously and manage them all from one place.
The Termux interface provides simple one-line commands for all operations.
GitHub Actions orchestrates the workflow while Colab provides the computing power.
This integrated approach makes professional ML accessible from any Android device.
Start experimenting with small datasets and gradually scale up as you learn.
